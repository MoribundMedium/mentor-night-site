## Getting Started

From the command line, you can run:

- `npm install` - Installs dependencies for this project.
- `npm run develop` - Runs the site in development mode, allows for live editing.
- `npm run build` - Builds the site for deployment in `public` folder, which we ignore with git.
- `npm run analyze` - See what ESLint and Prettier can fix.
- `npm run fix` - Run Prettier and ESLint with the `--fix` option.
- `npm run test` - TODO: https://gatsby.dev/unit-testing\

If you are using VS Code, we have recommended extensions listed in the `mentor-night-site.code-workspace` file. VS Code will automatically detect that list and prompt you to install.
